Landing page for the js-and-friends React workshop

## Hi and welcome!

In this workshop, we're going to walk through some introductory examples for [React] using some of the latest updates, Hooks! We will then have some time to explore what we just learned through various exercises related to the concepts that were discussed. 

## Goals

The main goals are to learn more about React components, and how we can visualize our UI as a series of components. Our components can be thought of as the rendered output that we receive based on our components' state and props. From there, we want to talk about some of the hooks that help us build dynamic and engaging web applications!
